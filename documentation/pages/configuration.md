# Configuration

Amp uses a YAML file to define preferences that sit in a platform-dependent configuration folder. The easiest way to edit these is to use the built-in `preferences::edit` command, which can be run in command mode. There's a corresponding `reload` command, too, if you persist any changes.

!!! tip
    If you want to version this file, the aforementioned `edit` command will
    display the full path at the bottom of the screen once the preferences have
    been loaded into a new buffer for editing.

## General Options

### Theme

```yaml
theme: solarized_dark
```

Used to specify the default theme. Values can be located through Amp's theme mode.

!!! tip
    You can configure the current theme without making a permanent configuration
    change. Hit `t` to pick a theme that'll only last until you close the editor.
    It's handy for temporarily changing to a lighter theme when working outdoors,
    or vice-versa.

### Tab Width

```yaml
tab_width: 2
```

Determines the visual width of tab characters, and when `soft_tabs` is `true`, determines the number of spaces to insert when a soft tab is inserted.

### Soft Tabs

```yaml
soft_tabs: true
```

This setting configures the type of tabs used in insert mode.
See: the infamous tabs vs. spaces debate.

### Line Length Guide

```yaml
line_length_guide: 80
```

When set to a positive integer, this renders a background vertical line at the specified offset, to guide line length. When set to `false`, the guide is hidden.


### Line Wrapping

```yaml
line_wrapping: true
```

When set to `true`, lines extending beyond the visible region are wrapped to the line below.

## File Format-Specific Options

The `tab_width` and `soft_tabs` options can be configured on a per-extension basis:

```yaml
types:
  rs:
    tab_width: 4
    soft_tabs: true
  go:
    tab_width: 8
    soft_tabs: false
```

For setting options for common files _without_ extensions, use a file name:

```yaml
types:
  Makefile:
    tab_width: 4
    soft_tabs: false
```

### Line Commenting
```yaml
types:
  rs:
    line_comment_prefix: //
```

This can be used to set the character (sequence) used by the `buffer::toggle_line_comment`
command for adding (or removing) single-line comments on a per-extension or per-file basis.
An additional whitespace character will also be inserted between prefix and line content.

## Key Bindings

In Amp, key bindings are simple key/command associations, scoped to a specific mode. You can define custom key bindings by defining a keymap in your preferences file:

```yaml
keymap:
  normal:
    j: "cursor::move_down"
```

!!! tip
    Wondering where to find command names? You can view the full list in a new buffer by running `application::display_available_commands` using [command mode](usage.md#running-commands). You can also view Amp's default key bindings by running `application::display_default_keymap`.

### Modifiers

Amp supports qualifying key bindings with a `ctrl` modifier:

```yaml
keymap:
  normal:
    ctrl-s: "buffer::save"
```

### Wildcards

You can also use wildcards in key bindings:

```yaml
keymap:
  normal:
    _: "buffer::insert_char"
```

More specific key bindings will override wildcard values, making them useful as a fallback value:

```
   ...
    _: "buffer::insert_char"
    s: "buffer::save"
```

### Multiple Commands

You can also pass a collection of commands to run. Amp will run all of the commands in order, stopping if/when any errors occur:

```yaml
keymap:
  normal:
    v:
      - "application::switch_to_select_mode"
      - "application::switch_to_jump_mode"
```

!!! tip
    It may not be readily apparent, but chaining commands like this is powerful. A significant portion of Amp's functionality is
    built by composing multiple commands into larger, more complex ones.

## Format/Language Support

Most popular formats and languages have syntax highlighting and symbol support out of the box. If you have a file open that _isn't_ higlighted, there are a few things you can do.

### Manually Picking a Definition

It's possible Amp has a syntax definition for the current file, but it's not being applied because it doesn't recognize the current filename or extension as having been associated with the definition. You can explicitly apply a definition by pressing `#` to enter syntax mode, and searching by the language/format name.

To make this syntax selection permanent, you can specify it in your preferences file:

```yaml
types:
  rs:
    syntax: Rust
```

### Adding a New Definition

If the language/format you're using isn't highlighted, and you can't find its definition using the manual selection tool described above, you'll need to add it. You can extend the built-in set with custom syntax definitions. Amp uses Sublime Text's [`.sublime-syntax`](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html) files, which can be placed in Amp's `syntaxes` configuration subdirectory.

!!! tip
    If you're not sure where to look, run the `preferences::edit` command.
    The preferences will load into a new buffer for editing, and its path
    will be shown at the bottom of the screen; the `syntaxes` subdirectory is in
    the same directory as that file.

## Themes

Amp includes [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) dark and light themes by default. You can extend the built-in set with custom themes of your own. Amp uses Text Mate's `.tmTheme` format, many of which can be found [here](http://wiki.macromates.com/Themes/UserSubmittedThemes). They should be placed in Amp's `themes` configuration subdirectory.

!!! tip
    If you're not sure where to look, run the `preferences::edit` command.
    The preferences will load into a new buffer for editing, and its path
    will be shown at the bottom of the screen; the `themes` subdirectory is in
    the same directory as that file.

## Open Mode

### Excluding Files/Directories

Using Unix shell-style glob patterns, Amp's file finder can be configured to exclude files and directories:

```yaml
open_mode:
  exclusions:
    - "**/.git"
    - "**/.svn"
```

You can also opt out of exclusions altogether by setting the value to `false`:

```yaml
open_mode:
  exclusions: false
```

## Miscellaneous

### Search/Select Results

The UI component used in open mode (and command mode, symbol jump mode, etc.)
is referred to as _search/select_, internally. You can configure the number of
results shown for any mode that uses this component:

```yaml
search_select:
  max_results: 5
```
