# Amp: A text editor for your terminal.

Heavily inspired by Vi/Vim. Amp aims to take the core interaction model of Vim,
simplify it, and bundle in the essential features required for a modern text
editor.

Written with :heart: in [Rust](http://rust-lang.org).

Amp's internals (data structures, syntax highlighting, workspace management, etc.)
have been built as a separate crate: [scribe](https://github.com/jmacdonald/scribe).

For a full overview, along with documentation and installation instructions, visit [amp.rs](https://amp.rs).
